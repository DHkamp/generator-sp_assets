# generator-sp_assets

This is a yeoman generator for creating columns and contenttypes for SharePoint projects.

If you don't know what yeoman is, take a look [here](http://yeoman.io/).

Install this generator by executing 

```
npm i -g generator-sp_assets
```

in your favourite terminal.

## Missing pieces
+ Currently not all column types are supported.
+ Inhereting custom parent contenttypes is not yet implemented.

## Usage 
```
yo sp_assets
```

## Creating a column

```
yo sp_assets:column
```

## Creating a contenttype
```
yo sp_assets:contenttype
```

Any help on further improvements is highly appreciated.
